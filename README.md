# IST240FinalProject
 This was the final project for the IST240 class I took at Penn State.
 This project was to be done in groups of two if I remember correctly but I chose to do it alone.
 The basic idea was to have a game where you go to Penn State campuses around Pennsylvania and play a minigame at five different campuses, with six minigames in total.
 Other requirements included having a theme selection and character selection that each affected things in the games.
 Unfortunately I lost the finished project I turned in, so I had to remake about 20-30% of the project, which was more or less the mechanics to two of the minigames and the final score screen.
 Overall I'm extremely happy with how it turned out, and it was easily the best of the class, with the professor being blown away when he tested it.
